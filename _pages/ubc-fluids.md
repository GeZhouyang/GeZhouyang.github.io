**Neuromechanical model of injured lampreys locomotion**

**Dr. Lisa Fauci**

*Pendergraft Nola Lee Haynes Professor of Mathematics*
*Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA* 

**Abstract**
In some vertebrates such as lampreys, swimming function can be regained after spinal injuries, but the exact mechanism of this recovery is not well understood. One hypothesis is that amplified proprioceptive (body-sensing) feedback can allow an injured lamprey to regain functional swimming even if the descending signal is lost. Here we present a multiscale model of an undulatory swimmer whose neural signaling is driven by a phase oscillator model that is fully coupled to a viscous, incompressible fluid. We examine the effects of amplified feedback on swimming behavior, and show that in some cases, feedback amplification below a spinal lesion is sufficient to partially or entirely restore effective swimming behavior. This is joint work with Christina Hamlet (Mathematics, Bucknell University), Eric Tytell (Biology, Tufts University) and Jen Morgan (Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole). 

**Bio**
Lisa Fauci received her PhD from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, and directly after that joined the Department of Mathematics at Tulane University in New Orleans. Her research focuses on biological fluid dynamics, with an emphasis on using modeling and simulation to study the basic biophysics of organismal locomotion and reproductive mechanics. Lisa served as president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in 2019-2020.  In 2023, she was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences.

**A Unified Eulerian Variational Framework for Multiphase Fluid-structure Interaction**

**Dr. Xiaoyu Mao**

*Department of Mechanical Engineering, UBC*

**Abstract**
Multiphase fluid-structure interaction is a bi-directional coupling between multiphase fluids with immersed/floating deformable structures. It is omnipresent in biological flows and marine/offshore engineering applications such as cardiovascular systems, offshore wind turbines, oil/gas platforms and ships. Of particular interest in this work is to develop a fully coupled continuum mechanics framework for multiphase and multicomponent fluid-structure interaction with contact dynamics and topology changes.  The framework unifies the kinematic descriptions of both fluids and solids in a spatially fixed Eulerian frame of reference. Evolving fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces are captured by the phase-field description. Specifically, we developed a novel interface and geometry-preserving phase-field method for consistent diffuse interface transition and accurate geometric representation. The proposed framework has been systematically assessed for an increasing complexity of problems such as multiple bubbles rising with surface tension effect, the flow passing an elastic solid and a cylinder-flexible plate system, contact of immersed deformable solids and a full-scale demonstration of ship-ice-water-air interaction. With our parallelized 3D FEM-based implementation, the framework enables high-performance computing and high-fidelity simulation of general multiphase FSI problems for both low and high Reynolds numbers. 

**Bio**
Xiaoyu is a post-doctoral fellow in the Computational Multiphysics Lab under the supervision of Prof. Rajeev Jaiman at UBC. After defending his Ph.D. thesis in August, he is currently working on ANSYS funded project focusing on the numerical stability of fluid-structure interaction for biomechanics and marine engineering applications. He has developed the interface and geometry-preserving methods for a novel and general-purpose unified continuum mechanics framework, which can simulate multiphase fluid-structure interactions with contact dynamics and topology changes at low and high Reynolds numbers.
