**Title:**
Stirring by microswimmers and their interaction with boundaries

**Abstract:** 
Microswimmers and active particles have become a key part of modern soft matter modeling. I will discuss two applications. The first involves how microswimmers affect their environment through their motion -- that is, how much fluid stirring they provide. Recent experiments have measured the displacement of small microspheres and characterized their statistics with a high degree of precision, allowing us to test the validity of various theories. We will see how to explain the non-Gaussian statistics observed in experiments, and to
predict key quantities such as the effective diffusivity. In the second part, we will examine the dispersion of the microswimmers themselves. How does their swimming, and their interactions with boundaries, dictate how they migrate down narrow channels, such as a pipette? The exact shape of the swimmer plays an important role, since it affects how swimmers align with boundaries.

**Title:**
Active particles in inhomogeneous environments

**Abstract:** 
Active particles are living or non-living entities that convert stored energy to directed motion, and a suspension of these particles is termed active matter. Examples of active particles include nanorobots, microorganisms, birds, fish, and humans. These particles often navigate through inhomogeneous environments such as gradients in heat, light, nutrients, fluid viscosity, or density. They typically respond to these inhomogeneities by displaying directed motion up or down the gradients, known as taxis. Some well-known types of taxis are chemotaxis in chemical/nutrient gradients, phototaxis in light gradients, and gravitaxis in gravitational field. 

Here I focus on the Î¼m - mm sized particles swimming in fluid viscosity or density gradients. I discuss the recently understood taxis in viscosity gradients (viscotaxis). I also talk about how these particles behave as light when interacting with sharp viscosity gradients, and how this behavior can be described by a Snell's like law. I then discuss a new taxis in density gradients (densitaxis), that possibly aids/hinders the diel vertical migration of planktonic organisms in oceans. I also talk about the mixing by these particles and different ways to quantify it. Lastly, I discuss the effect of noise and how the aforesaid inhomogeneities could be used to control active matter under confinements.

**Bio:**
Vaseem obtained his PhD from Purdue University in 2020. In his research, Vaseem uses asymptotic techniques to understand the motion of particles or swimming organisms in complex flows. His current interests are fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of active matter.

**Title:**
Neuromechanical model of injured lampreys locomotion

**Abstract:**
In some vertebrates such as lampreys, swimming function can be regained after spinal injuries, but the exact mechanism of this recovery is not well understood. One hypothesis is that amplified proprioceptive (body-sensing) feedback can allow an injured lamprey to regain functional swimming even if the descending signal is lost. Here we present a multiscale model of an undulatory swimmer whose neural signaling is driven by a phase oscillator model that is fully coupled to a viscous, incompressible fluid. We examine the effects of amplified feedback on swimming behavior, and show that in some cases, feedback amplification below a spinal lesion is sufficient to partially or entirely restore effective swimming behavior. This is joint work with Christina Hamlet (Mathematics, Bucknell University), Eric Tytell (Biology, Tufts University) and Jen Morgan (Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole). 

**Bio:**
Lisa Fauci received her PhD from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, and directly after that joined the Department of Mathematics at Tulane University in New Orleans. Her research focuses on biological fluid dynamics, with an emphasis on using modeling and simulation to study the basic biophysics of organismal locomotion and reproductive mechanics. Lisa served as president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in 2019-2020.  In 2023, she was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences.

**Title:**
A Unified Eulerian Variational Framework for Multiphase Fluid-structure Interaction

**Abstract:**
Multiphase fluid-structure interaction is a bi-directional coupling between multiphase fluids with immersed/floating deformable structures. It is omnipresent in biological flows and marine/offshore engineering applications such as cardiovascular systems, offshore wind turbines, oil/gas platforms and ships. Of particular interest in this work is to develop a fully coupled continuum mechanics framework for multiphase and multicomponent fluid-structure interaction with contact dynamics and topology changes.  The framework unifies the kinematic descriptions of both fluids and solids in a spatially fixed Eulerian frame of reference. Evolving fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces are captured by the phase-field description. Specifically, we developed a novel interface and geometry-preserving phase-field method for consistent diffuse interface transition and accurate geometric representation. The proposed framework has been systematically assessed for an increasing complexity of problems such as multiple bubbles rising with surface tension effect, the flow passing an elastic solid and a cylinder-flexible plate system, contact of immersed deformable solids and a full-scale demonstration of ship-ice-water-air interaction. With our parallelized 3D FEM-based implementation, the framework enables high-performance computing and high-fidelity simulation of general multiphase FSI problems for both low and high Reynolds numbers. 

**Bio:**
Xiaoyu is a post-doctoral fellow in the Computational Multiphysics Lab under the supervision of Prof. Rajeev Jaiman at UBC. After defending his Ph.D. thesis in August, he is currently working on ANSYS funded project focusing on the numerical stability of fluid-structure interaction for biomechanics and marine engineering applications. He has developed the interface and geometry-preserving methods for a novel and general-purpose unified continuum mechanics framework, which can simulate multiphase fluid-structure interactions with contact dynamics and topology changes at low and high Reynolds numbers.

**Title:**
Rheology of periodically sheared suspensions undergoing reversible-irreversible transition
 
**Abstract:**
Suspensions are fluids loaded with solid particles that interact hydrodynamically through the suspending fluid and non-hydrodynamically upon direct contact. Interestingly, when sheared periodically at low Reynolds number, the particle dynamics can undergo a reversible-irreversible transition (RIT) characterized by a critical strain amplitude: below this amplitude, all particles return to their original positions after each period; above it, they diffuse. In this talk, I will describe the corresponding rheology of this process. Specifically, I will show that there are at least four rheological signatures at the onset of RIT, and they are related to the emergent dynamics through a shear-induced microstructure that tends to be hyperuniform at steady state. Furthermore, I will discuss the possibility of a second transition threshold and the associated suspension rheology, even if the particles are only weakly adhesive. In general, these results suggest that non-hydrodynamic interactions dictate the particle dynamics, while hydrodynamic interactions influence the suspension rheology.
