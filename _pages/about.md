I am a postdoctoral researcher in fluid mechanics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
I am also affiliated with the Soft Matter Group at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

My current research interests are at the intersection of fluid mechanics and active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in how hydrodynamic interactions, say, between algae in water,
affect their collective motions and the bulk fluid properties.
I explore these questions numerically by doing computer simulations.
Most of the programs I use are open-source and can be downloaded from the Github page on the left.

Active fluids are not only of fundamental interest,
but also have potential applications in many emerging industries vital to our future societies.
Examples include directed drug delivery, 
CO2 sequestration, biofuel production,
plant-based meat cultivation, and perhaps more.
