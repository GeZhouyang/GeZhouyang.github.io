I am a postdoc in fluid mechanics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
I am also affiliated with KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden) 
through an international grant sponsored by the Swedish Research council.

My current research is at the intersection of complex fluids, multiphase flow, and active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in dense particle suspensions, 
where large amounts of microscopic particles (e.g., microplastics or microswimmers)
are suspended in a fluid environment and coupled to each other by hydrodynamic interactions.
When driven away from equilibrium - by either an external motion or the particles themselves, or both - 
the particles may self-organize, exhibit enhanced diffusion, 
or even move together as a "superfluid" (i.e., with a vanishing viscosity).
Although hydrodynamic interactions are widely believed to play an important role in many of these phenomena,
obtaining an accurate understanding of their effects has remained difficult due to the nonequilibrium nature and many-body interactions involved (theories usually don't work in dense suspensions).
It is important to obtain a quantitative understanding of the hydrodynamic effects,
if we want to utilize them in practical applications (e.g., directed drug delivery or biofuel production).
The goal of my research is to provide such understandings in driven dense suspensions.

I develop and use advanced numerical solvers to study the dynamics and rheology of complex and active fluids.
Currently, I am maintaining a GPU-accelerated solver called Fast Stokesian Dynamics, which was originally developed at MIT.
In the past, I have also worked with various other methods for reduced-order modelling of dense suspensions
and direct numerical simulations of multiphase flow, see the GitHub page for details.
