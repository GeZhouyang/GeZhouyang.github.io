I am a postdoc in fluid mechanics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
Officially, I am also affiliated with KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden,
though I am currently in Canada.

My research is at the intersection of complex fluids, multiphase flow, and active matter.
Specifically, I study dense particle suspensions -- the "simplest" complex fluids which display many interesting phenomena
such as self-organization, enhanced diffusion, or even "superfluidic" rheologies.
The main question my research tries to answer is "_How do hydrodynamic interactions affect those behaviors?_"
Addressing this question is not only of fundamental physical interest (nonequilibrium statistical mechanics),
but also has practical implications in applications as diverse as directed drug delivery and biofuel production.

I develop and use advanced numerical solvers to simulate the dynamics of complex and active fluids.
The programs I use are all open-source (see the Github page) and I am happy to help if you have any questions.
