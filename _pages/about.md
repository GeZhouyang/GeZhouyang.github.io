Welcome!
I am a researcher in fluid mechanics.
Specifically, I am interested in the physics of complex fluids,
such as dense particle suspensions, droplet emulsions, and biological fluids.
The methods of inquiry are mainly computational.
Feel free to contact me for questions or collaborations.

## Current position

Postdoctoral Research Fellow
(advised by Prof. Gwynn Elfring),
{{site.author.affiliation}}, University of British Columbia.

Chaotic mixing due to hydrodynamic interactions.
Shown is an active suspension (positive shakers) at 40% volume fraction.

![droplets](images/cover_pic.png "Droplets")
Droplets in homogeneous shear turbulence.
This image was produced by Suhas Jain (then PhD student at Stanford) in 2018.
