I am a postdoc in fluid mechanics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada,
and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

My current research interests are at the intersection of fluid mechanics and active matter.
Specifically, I study dense particle suspensions,
i.e., fluids containing a large amount of particles,
to understand how hydrodynamic interactions between individual particles
affect their collective motion and the bulk fluid properties.
I was trained in computational fluid dynamics and
I conduct my research mainly via detailed numerical simulations.

Active matter are not only of fundamental physical interest but also have potential practical applications,
such as directed drug delivery or biofuel/cultured meat production.
My research goal is to contribute to the understanding and development of active matter
using rigorous hydrodynamic theories and advanced numerical simulations.
