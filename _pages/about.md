I am a postdoctoral researcher in fluid mechanics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
I am also affiliated with the Soft Matter Group at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

My current research interests are at the intersection of fluid mechanics and active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in how hydrodynamic interactions, say, between algae in water,
affect their collective motions and the bulk fluid properties.
I explore these questions numerically by doing computer simulations.
Most of the programs I use are open-source and can be downloaded from the GitHub page on the left.

Active fluids are not only interesting to study,
but also have many potential applications in the emerging industries that are vital to our future.
Examples include directed drug delivery, 
CO2 sequestration, biofuel production,
plant-based meat cultivation, etc.
