I am a postdoc in fluid mechanics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, 
and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

My current research interests are at the intersection of fluid mechanics and soft/active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in how hydrodynamic interactions between individual particles in a suspension
affect their collective motions and the bulk fluid properties.
I explore these questions numerically via CPU/GPU simulations.
Most of the programs I use are open-source and can be downloaded from my Github page.

Complex and active fluids are not only of fundamental physical interest,
but also have potential applications in emerging industries or technology,
e.g. directed drug delivery, CO2 sequestration, biofuel and plant-based meat production, etc.
