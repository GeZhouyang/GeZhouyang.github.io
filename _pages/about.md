Welcome to my website!
Here you will find brief information about me and my research.
Currently, I am very interested in the subject of *active matter*,
which refer to systems made of self-propelling units.
As a fluid mechanician, I am particularly interested in
how *hydrodynamic interactions* between individual [microswimmers](https://z-p42.www.instagram.com/p/CJ9bqegj48I/)
affect their collective motions.
Such investigations are primarily curiosity-driven,
but they may also have practical implications for important industries such as biomedicine and biofuel.
I study the physics of soft matter mainly using computational fluid dynamics (CFD),
thus considerable efforts are spent on method developments.
Feel free to browse around and contact me if you have any questions.
