I am an assistant professor of fluid mechanics at Nanjing University in Suzhou, China.
Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada,
and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

My current research is at the intersection of complex fluids, multiphase flow, and active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in particle suspensions -- the "simplest" complex fluids that display a multitude of
interesting phenomena such as self-organization, enhanced diffusion, or even "superfluidic" rheologies.
The main focus of my research is to understand how hydrodynamic interactions affect those behaviors.
This is a rapidly developing area not only of fundamental physical interest,
but also with practical implications in applications as diverse as directed drug delivery and microrobot navigation.

I develop and use advanced numerical solvers to simulate the dynamics of complex and active fluids.
The programs I use are all open-source (see the Github page) and I am happy to help if you have any question.


## Opening
 
I am looking for a postdoc (more info [here](files/postdoc_active_fluids_NJU.pdf)) to join me in Suzhou.
If you are interested, feel free to drop me an email briefly describing yourself and your research experience.
All backgrounds, genders, nationalities, and age are welcome! (Students are always welcome to contact me for
potential internships and PhD positions.)
