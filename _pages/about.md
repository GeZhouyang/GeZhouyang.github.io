Welcome to my website!
Here you will find brief information about me and my research.
My current interest is *active matter*,
i.e. physical systems made of active units such as cells or microswimmers.
As a fluid mechanician, I am particularly interested in
how *hydrodynamic interactions* between individual microswimmers affect their collective motions
and the bulk fluid properties.
Such investigations are not only driven by curiosity,
but also by potential applications in vital industries such as biomedicine and biofuel
(e.g. directed drug delivery, CO2 sequestration and fuel production, etc).
I study the hydrodynamic effects in active matter using *computational fluid dynamics* (CFD).
Feel free to download the source codes (see GitHub) and contact me if you have any questions.
