I am a postdoc in fluid mechanics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada.
I am also affiliated with KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden) 
through an international grant sponsored by the Swedish Research council.

My current research is at the intersection of complex fluids, multiphase flow, and active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in _dense particle suspensions_, 
where large amounts of microscopic particles (e.g., microplastics or microswimmers)
are suspended in a fluid environment and coupled by many-body hydrodynamic interactions.
When driven away from the equilibrium (either by an external motion or by the particles themselves, or both), 
dense suspensions can display a multitude of interesting phenomena,
including self-organization, enhanced diffusion, or even a superfluidic rheology.
It is widely believed that hydrodynamic interactions play an important role in many of these behaviors;
however, the present understanding is often not rigorous due to the difficulty in modelling the hydrodynamics accurately. 
The goals of my research are to provide rigorous understanding of the hydrodynamic effects in driven dense suspensions 
and discover new phenomena.

I study the dynamics and rheological properties of complex/active fluids mainly using numerical simulations.
The methods I have used include (fast) Stokesian dynamics, (hybrid) lubrication dynamics, 
and various methods (level set, ghost fluid, phase field, etc.) for direct numerical simulations.
I enjoy collaborating with experimentalists and other theorists,
so feel free to write to me if you like to work on something together!
