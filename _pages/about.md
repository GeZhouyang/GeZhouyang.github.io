Welcome to my website!
Here you will find brief information about me and my research.
Currently, I am interested in the subject of soft (active) matter,
which include colloids, polymers, sands, [microswimmers](https://z-p42.www.instagram.com/p/CJ9bqegj48I/), etc.
As a fluid mechanician, I am particularly interested in 
how hydrodynamic interactions between individual particles affect their collective motions.
Such investigations are primarily out of fundamental interest,
but they may also practical implications for important industries such as biomedicine and biofuel.
I study the physics of soft matter mainly using computational fluid dynamics (CFD),
thus considerable efforts are spent on method developments.
I hope you find the content on this little website useful.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Chaotic mixing due to hydrodynamic interactions.
Shown is an active suspension (positive shakers) at 40% volume fraction.

Droplets in homogeneous shear turbulence.
This image was produced from a high-resolution simulation published
[here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/droplets-in-homogeneous-shear-turbulence/49BE8A80FEFCFB934104005EB74A7E69).
