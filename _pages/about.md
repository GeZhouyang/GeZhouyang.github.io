I am an assistant professor in fluid mechanics at Nanjing University in Suzhou, China.
Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada,
and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

My current research is at the intersection of complex fluids, multiphase flow, and active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in particle suspensions -- the "simplest" complex fluids that display a multitude of
interesting phenomena such as self-organization, enhanced diffusion, or even "superfluidic" rheologies.
The main focus of my research is to understand how hydrodynamic interactions affect those behaviors.
Understanding this relationship is not only of fundamental physical interest,
but also has practical implications in applications as diverse as directed drug delivery and biofuel production.

I develop and use advanced numerical solvers to simulate the dynamics of complex and active fluids.
The programs I use are all open-source (see the Github page) and I am happy to help if you have any question.
