Welcome to my website!
Here you will find brief information about me and my research.
I am particularly interested in the subject of soft/active matter
from the perspective of a fluid mechanician.
Questions like "How do hydrodynamic interactions affect the emergent dynamics of bacterial suspensions?"
are not only of fundamental interest,
but also have practical implications for important industries such as biomedicine and biofuel.
I study the physics of soft matter mainly using hydrodynamical simulations,
thus considerable efforts are spent on method development.
I hope you find the content on this little website useful,
and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Chaotic mixing due to hydrodynamic interactions.
Shown is an active suspension (positive shakers) at 40% volume fraction.

![droplets](images/cover_pic.png "Droplets")
Droplets in homogeneous shear turbulence.
This image was produced from a high-resolution simulation published
[here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/droplets-in-homogeneous-shear-turbulence/49BE8A80FEFCFB934104005EB74A7E69).
