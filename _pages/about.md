Welcome to my personal website!
I am a researcher in fluid mechanics.
More specifically, I am interested in physical problems
at the intersection of fluid mechanics and soft matter,
e.g. self-organization of particles in Stokes flow and dynamics of active suspensions.
The methods of inquiry are mainly computational.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my research
or would like to collaborate on a project.

## Current position

Postdoctoral Research Fellow
(advised by Prof. Gwynn Elfring),
{{site.author.affiliation}}, University of British Columbia.

Chaotic mixing due to hydrodynamic interactions.
Shown is an active suspension (positive shakers) at 40% volume fraction.

Droplets in homogeneous shear turbulence.
This image was produced by Suhas Jain (then PhD student at Stanford) in 2018.
