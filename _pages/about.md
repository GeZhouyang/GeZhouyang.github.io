I am a postdoctoral researcher in fluid mechanics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
I am also affiliated with the Soft Matter Group at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

My current research interests are at the intersection of fluid mechanics and active matter.
Specifically, I am interested in how hydrodynamic interactions between microswimmers
affect their collective motions and the bulk fluid properties.
I explore these questions numerically by doing CPU/GPU simulations.
Most of the programs I use are open-source and can be downloaded from my Github page.

Active fluids are not only of fundamental interest,
but also have potential applications in emerging industries or technology,
e.g. directed drug delivery, CO2 sequestration, biofuel and plant-based meat production, etc.
