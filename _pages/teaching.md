## Applications of Classical Mechanics (PHYS 350, Winter 2022, UBC)

This was an undergrad course on classical mechanics (e.g. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics),
instructed by Professor [Mona Berciu](https://phas.ubc.ca/~berciu/).
I gave a guest lecture near the end of the course on the topic of
*Q-learning*, based on the example of a simple microswimmer.

The detailed course materials (lecture notes and demo code) are
[here](https://github.com/GeZhouyang/two-link-swimmer).

## Boundary layer lab, Heat engines lab (SG1217, SG2214, SG1216, 2016-2019, KTH)

These labs were part of the degree program for Engineering Physics and
Aerospace/Vehicle Engineering students at KTH (mainly undergrad level).
I was among the lab instructors during the middle of my PhD years.
Each lab was 2-3 hours and involved 3-5 students.
My main role was helping the students connect the theory to reality,
and leading them to do the experiments.

Fun fact: We were interviewed by the Swedish National TV during one experiment

## Dynamics of fluids (AME 309, 2014-2015, USC)

This was an undergrad course on fluid dynamics.
I was the grading assistant for Professor [Veronica Eliasson](http://eliasson.mines.edu/)
and Dr. David C. Wilcox, respectively.
